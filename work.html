                    <p>Since people believe salt brings bad luck, we made <a href="unlucky.html"> our client Cris-Sal sponsor 
                        Ecuador's rivals during the World Cup.</a><br><br>

                        Ecuadorians thought seniors weren't worth the hire. Ironically, <a href="senior.html">they had the experience their businesses
                        needed.</a><br><br>

                        Ecuadorians use amorfinos to express their love (excluding same sex couples). 
                        We helped Xtrim <a href="amorfinos.html">defy culture and prove that love is love.</a><br><br>

                        Ecuadorian law prohibits medicine to be sold in indingenous languages. So we used

                        (Student) New artists have a hard time getting spotlight. So Pepsi and Bad Bunny
                        launched a new song with blank spaces for new artists to feature in. <br><br>

                        (Student) Abortion is illegal in almost every Latinamerican country except for Argentina.
                        So, to help women get the treatment they needed, Planned Parenthood invited all Latinamerican women to the only place in their country were abortions were legal: Argentina's embassy.
