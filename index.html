                    This website is a canvas of simplicity - just a white background and grey letters. <br><br>
                    Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>
                    
                    A deliberate choice by us: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joserranot/">José Serrano</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joséreinoso593/">José Reinoso</a>.
                    Two copywriters in a world dazzled by imagery. A world that always asks: <i>And who is the art director?</i><br><br>
                    
                    And... sure. We could've jazzed things up, added some visuals here and there. But that might have meant roping in more hands, more cooks in the kitchen, possibly even muddling
                    our message. We're action-driven, valuing common sense over convolution. And this website? It's a testament to that.<br><br>
                    
                    In the midst of visuals screaming for attention everywhere else, our site is a pause, a breath, a moment of simplicity. Because for us, good ideas don't need frills.<br><br> 
                    When words are crafted with care, who needs the glitter?
